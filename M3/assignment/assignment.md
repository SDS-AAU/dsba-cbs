# M3 - Deep Learning Kick-off Assignment

In this assignment you will revisit the [AirBnb dataset](http://data.insideairbnb.com/denmark/hovedstaden/copenhagen/2020-06-26/data/listings.csv.gz) that we used in M1. 

## 1. Build a neural net for price prediction.

Your job is to build a feed-forward network using Keras to predict the price.
Can you beat the performance of other models that we explored in M1 (using the same set of independent variables)? Start with a "simpler" baseline model using 1 2 layers only (one input layer one output layer).

## 2. Tune the network.

Experiment with different set-ups changing e.g.:

- number of neurons
- number of layers 
- number of epochs and batch size
- activation functions (reasonable choices)
- optimizers and losses (again: reasonable choices)

Use the Keras documentation and community sources to identify best practices. However, do not spend hours on grid search!

## 3. Prevent overfitting

This part is related to 2. Explore the training process (over the epochs). Explore and describe 2 common approaches used to prevent overfitting in deep feed-forward neural nets.

Try to implement them on your data.
