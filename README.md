# Course Page: Data Science for Business Applications
The central repository for the cours "Data Science fo Business Analytics" (DSBA) at Copenhagen Business School (CBS). Here, you will find all teaching material and further information.

## General Information
* The corresponding CBS CANVAS course page can be found [here](https://cbscanvas.instructure.com/courses/11902). Note that `github` rather than CANVAS will represent the central hub for teaching material.
* Teaching assistant: Christian Døj Friis (<cdf.digi@cbs.dk>): Feel free to ask for guidance :) (Communication via MA Teams preffered)

## Main Teaching Reference
While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.  We generally recommed you to use these amazing ressources for problem-solfing and further self-study on the topic.

# Modules
The course is structured in 3 modules, where their content can be found in the corresponding subfolders

## [M1: Applied Data Science and Machine Learning](https://sds-aau.github.io/dsba-cbs//M1)
This module will prove a condensed introduction to the “Data Science Pipeline”, introducing students to methods, techniques, and workflows in applied data analytics and machine learning, including data acquisition, preparation, analysis, visualization, and communication.

## [M2: Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing](https://sds-aau.github.io/dsba-cbs/M2)
Focuses on analyzing a variety of unstructured data sources. Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.

## [M3: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics](https://sds-aau.github.io/dsba-cbs/M3)
Introduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.
